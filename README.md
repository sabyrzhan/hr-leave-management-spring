Practice project to learn SOLID principle and CQRS in Java.

The original course is [ASP.NET Core - SOLID and Clean Architecture (.NET 5 and Up)](https://www.udemy.com/course/aspnet-core-solid-and-clean-architecture-net-5-and-up/) 
which is explained using C# language. But since I am specialized in Java language I 
did all the practices in Java.

## Used technologies
